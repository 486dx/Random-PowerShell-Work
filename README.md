This is a conglomeration of PowerShell scripts that I've written over the years. If you'd like more PowerShell awesomeness check out my blog at [Adam, the Automator](http://www.adamtheautomator.com).  This is where I write about automation, lots of PowerShell and post regularly about time-saving tricks with PowerShell.

**WARNING: I cannot guarantee all scripts in this repo have been thoroughly tested or even work at all! These are working scripts that are in all different stages of development. Use at your own risk!**
